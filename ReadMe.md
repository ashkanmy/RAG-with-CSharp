- The C# and LangChain platforms are used to train a RAG-system (based on gpt-3.5-turbo) on Harry Potter story.

- The motivation is to ask our RAG very much detailed questions, namely Q-1, Q-2 and Q-3. 

- The answers to Q-1, Q-2 and Q3 are shown as "green" and the question part is shown as "yellow".
